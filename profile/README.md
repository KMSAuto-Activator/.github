# KMSAuto Activator

An automatic activator for Microsoft products such as Windows and Office. It uses the KMS (Key Management Service) protocol to activate Microsoft products without the need to purchase a license. It activates office suites, client and server operating systems in several ways with a single click. The activator allows you to install and uninstall KMS services, perform automatic reactivation, and set your own keys.

## KMSAuto activator modes


1. **Activation**: automatic implementation of a mechanism that will allow you to successfully pass the authenticity check of the operating system or office programs. The application sequentially applies available hacking methods until activation is successfully completed. Additionally, it displays information about the status of the Windows/Office license: product name, version, ID, computer IP address, activation date, and reactivation frequency.

1. **Manual key installation**: allows you to enter your own GVLK keys through a pre-installed KMS node using a graphical interface rather than a command line. Supports the removal of installed keys and the addition of your own keys.

1. **Planner**: will implement reactivation tasks. Product authenticity is verified every 30 days, so the developer has provided for automatic activation every 10 days, but this can be changed in the scheduler library.
